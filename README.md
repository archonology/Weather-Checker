# Weather-Dashboard
A weather tracking website
By Reed Meher | U of MN coding Bootcamp 2022

### Site and Repo
Deployed Site: https://archonology.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## About the Project
The challenge was to make a site for checking weather around the world. Recent searches needed to be saved to localStorage and displayed in the html, so that users can easily call back past searches to monitor the current and upcoming weather.

## Page Functionality
 - when the page opens, the user will be prompted to search a city. Paris is the default search city, and it's current weather will be loaded upon page opening. It will also already have a saved city button the user can select later for calling back the Paris weather. 
 - when the user presses enter on the keyboard, or clicks "search", the weather API will be fetched and presented to the user.
 - current weather will show up in one card, and the five day forecast will show up in the card below. 
 - the images of weather conditions are also dynamically updated.
 - each city the user searches for will populate a button with that cities name below the search form. The user may click these to call back current weather forecast for that saved city.
 - if the user refreshes the page, the saved buttons will be still be present. 
 - now the user can keep track of places they are visiting, or plan to visit!

 Thanks for checking out my site, and let me know if you have questions!
