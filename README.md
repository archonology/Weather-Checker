# Weather-Checker
weekly challenge No.6
By Reed Meher | U of MN coding Bootcamp 2022

### Site and Repo
Deployed Site: https://archonology.github.io/Weather-Checker/
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/archonology/Weather-Checker

## About the Project
The challenge was to make a site for checking weather around the world. Recent searches needed to be saved to localStorage and displayed in the html, so that users can easily call back past searches to monitor the current and upcoming weather.

## Page Functionality
 - when the page opens, the user will be prompted to search a city. 
 - when the user presses enter on the keyboard, or clicks "search", the weather API will be fetched and presented to the user.
 - current weather will show up in one card, and the five day forecast will show up in the card below. 
 - the images of weather conditions are also dynamically updated.
 - if the user refreshes the page, new buttons will present in the search form -- one for each past search. if the user clicks one of these new buttons, the weather for that city will be called and presented to the user.  
 - now the user can keep track of places they are visiting, or plan to visit.

 Thanks for checking out my site, and let me know if you have questions!
